## Pro Ingenio Publico: For The Public Intellect
Just as many lawyers do _pro bono_ work (_pro bono publico_ meaning "for the public good") by donating a portion of their time to help members of the public, engineers should also donate a portion of their time as a form of volunteering. In fact, it would be reasonable to argue that engineering as a practice is a broad collection of knowledge and methodologies applicable to technical tasks, thus empowering engineers to problem-solve efficiently, sustainably and within time and budgetary constraints.
This very valuable set of skills applied intently can produce hugely useful results, and can inspire other profesionnals to surpass themselves; the thoughtful sharing of _ingenium_ ("wit" or "intellect") tends to better systems and improve the lives of those that live within them.
It is to the end of continuous growth of _ingenium_ that the term _pro ingenio_ (or _pro ingenio publico_, "for the public intellect") is proposed. _Pro ingenio_ work can include a variety of things, such as volunteer consulting for local non-profits, making and distributing educational content free of charge, organising work events that better ...

## Why software engineering is uniquely positioned to offer Pro Ingenio work
Unlike other fields of engineering, software engineering does not require procuring massive amounts of concrete, titanium or sodium hydroxide. It does not require million-dollar measuring devices thrown off by neighbouring vibrations. Software engineering can be fully learned and applied on a ten-year-old repurposed office desktop computer, and the experience gained with such a setup may very well be just as valuable as if the engineer used the latest hardware.
In fact, pushing that thought to its limits reveal that engineering as a practice is not necessarily linked to the materials and tools used; it is a broad collection of knowledge and methodologies applicable to technical tasks.
Thus engineering is the gathering and in-context application of _ingenium_.
